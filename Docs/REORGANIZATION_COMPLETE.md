## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. ✅ Isolation
- Photo library safe in PhotoLibraryManager.swift
- Live camera isolated in LiveCameraView.swift
- Work on one without affecting the other!

### 2. ✅ Xcode Previews Working
- ContentView has #Preview
- LiveCameraView has #Preview
- Preview canvas will work again!

### 3. ✅ Dark Mode Support
- Adaptive colors added
- Respects system appearance
- Works in both modes

### 4. ✅ Clean Logs
- Removed annoying repeated logs
- Kept important events only
- Console is readable again

### 5. ✅ Build Succeeds
- All files compile
- No errors
- Ready to run!

## 🚀 What You Can Do Now

### For Photo Library Mode (Already Working):
```swift
// Open: PhotoLibraryManager.swift
// Status: ✅ Working perfectly
// Action: Leave it alone! It works!
```

### For Live Camera Mode (To Perfect):
```swift
// Open: LiveCameraView.swift
// Status: 🔧 Needs refinement
// Action: This is where you focus!
```

### Known Issues to Fix in LiveCameraView:

1. **Confidence Discrepancy**
   - Live view shows ~1.5-2x confidence vs photo
   - Need to investigate why

2. **Frame Alignment** 
   - Using .resizeAspectFill on square views
   - Should match what ML sees
   - May need further validation

3. **Results Overlay**
   - Currently below camera (good!)
   - Shows top 5 results
   - No more obstructing view

## 📝 File Purposes

| File | Purpose | Status | Touch? |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| swift_camApp.swift | App entry | ✅ Done | No |
| SplashScreenView.swift | Startup | ✅ Done | No |
| SharedModels.swift | Common code | ✅ Done | Rarely |
| PhotoLibraryManager.swift | Photo mode | ✅ Working | NO! |
| LiveCameraView.swift | Live camera | 🔧 WIP | YES! |
| ContentView.swift | Main UI | ✅ Done | Rarely |

## 🔧 How to Work on Live Camera

1. Open `LiveCameraView.swift` in Xcode
2. Find the issue you want to fix
3. Make changes
4. Test in simulator
5. Photo library won't be affected!

## 🎨 Dark Mode

The app now supports dark mode via adaptive colors:
- Color.adaptiveBackground
- Color.adaptiveLabel
- Color.adaptiveSecondaryBackground
- Automatically adjusts with system

## 📸 SwiftUI Previews

Both main views have previews:

```swift
// ContentView.swift
#Preview {
    ContentView()
}

// LiveCameraView.swift
#Preview {
    @Previewable @State var selectedModel = MLModelType.mobileNet
    LiveCameraView(
        cameraManager: CameraManager(),
        selectedModel: $selectedModel
    )
}
```

Press `⌥⌘↩` (Option-Command-Enter) in Xcode to show/hide preview canvas!

## ✅ Checklist

- [x] Build succeeds
- [x] SwiftUI previews working
- [x] Dark mode support added
- [x] Logs cleaned up
