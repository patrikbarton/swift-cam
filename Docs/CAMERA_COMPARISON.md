#### **Camera Controls - Apple Native Style**
- 📷 **Zoom levels**: 0.5x (ultra-wide), 1x (wide), 3x (telephoto)
- 🔄 **Camera flip** - Smooth transition between front/back
- ❌ **Close button** - Top-left, translucent material background
- 🤖 **Model selector** - Compact pills (MobileNet/ResNet/FastViT)
- 🎚️ **Active state indicators** - Yellow highlight on active zoom/model

#### **Technical Capabilities**
- 🎥 **AVFoundation** - Full control over camera and frames
- 📸 **High-res capture** - Full device resolution for final photos
- 🧪 **Live video analysis** - Lower res (640x480) for fast ML inference
- 💾 **Model caching** - Instant switching between 3 models
- ⚡ **Neural Engine** - Hardware-accelerated ML inference
- 📊 **Object tracking** - Accumulates detections over time

## 🆚 Comparison: UIImagePickerController vs AVFoundation

### UIImagePickerController (Previous)
```
✅ Zero UI code needed
✅ Apple handles everything
✅ Always looks native
❌ NO live classification overlay
❌ NO access to video frames
❌ NO customization possible
❌ Can only classify AFTER capture
```

### AVFoundation + Custom UI (Current)
```
✅ Live real-time classification
✅ Custom overlays possible
✅ Access to every video frame
✅ Full camera control
✅ Looks like Apple Camera (with effort)
❌ Must build UI yourself
❌ More code to maintain
```

- No need to capture photo to see results
- Continuous scanning mode
- Perfect for "what is this?" scenarios

### **Still Capture Photos**
- Tap shutter button → Captures high-res photo
- Automatically classifies the captured image
- Returns to main app with results
- Full resolution for accurate classification

### **Switch Models Live**
- Change between MobileNet/ResNet/FastViT on the fly
- See different models' predictions in real-time
- Compare accuracy between models instantly

## 🚀 Performance Characteristics

### Frame Processing
- **Capture Resolution**: Device native (e.g., 12MP, 48MP)
- **Analysis Resolution**: 640x480 (for speed)
- **Frame Rate**: ~6-7 FPS analysis (every 0.15s)
- **Compute**: Neural Engine (Apple A-series chips)

### Model Switching
- **Instant**: All models pre-loaded and cached
- **No lag**: Switch between models in real-time
- **Memory efficient**: Models stay in RAM

### Real-Time Overlay
- **Latency**: ~150ms from capture to display
- **Smooth animations**: Core Animation
- **Auto-fade**: Results expire after 3 seconds
- **Conflict handling**: Highest confidence wins

## 💡 Design Decisions Explained

### Why Gradients?
- Matches iOS Camera app aesthetic
- Ensures text readability over any background
- Creates depth and visual hierarchy

### Why .ultraThinMaterial?
- Standard iOS translucent background
- Adapts to light/dark content automatically
- Provides blur without obscuring camera view

### Why 3 Results Max?
- Prevents visual clutter
- Focuses on most confident predictions
- Keeps UI clean and readable

### Why 640x480 Analysis?
- Balance between accuracy and speed
- Allows 6-7 FPS real-time processing
- ML models work well at this resolution
- Neural Engine can process this quickly

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Easy to Add)

### 1. AR Bounding Boxes
```swift
// Draw boxes around detected objects
overlay.add(rectangle at: objectLocation)
```

### 2. Confidence Threshold Filter
```swift
// Only show results above 50% confidence
results.filter { $0.confidence > 0.5 }
```

### 3. Haptic Feedback
```swift
// Vibrate when high-confidence detection
UIImpactFeedbackGenerator().impactOccurred()
```

### 4. Flash Control
```swift
// Add flash mode toggle (Auto/On/Off)
device.torchMode = .on
```

### 5. Focus/Exposure Tap
```swift
// Tap to focus (like Apple Camera)
device.focusPointOfInterest = tapLocation
```
