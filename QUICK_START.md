# üöÄ Quick Start Guide for Team Collaboration

## For You (Repository Owner)

### ‚úÖ What's Already Done
- [x] Project configured to use xcconfig for signing
- [x] Personal config is git-ignored
- [x] Example config file created
- [x] Setup script created
- [x] Documentation written

### When You Commit/Push

```bash
# Your normal workflow - no changes needed!
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push

# Your DeveloperSettings.xcconfig won't be committed ‚úÖ
```

### What to Tell Your Friend

Just send them this:

> Hey! I've set up the project so we don't have signing conflicts. After you clone:
> 
> 1. Run: `./setup-developer.sh`
> 2. Enter your Apple Team ID (find it at: https://developer.apple.com/account/#/membership)
> 3. Enter a bundle ID like: `com.yourname.swift-cam`
> 4. Open and build in Xcode!
> 
> After that, just pull and work normally - your settings won't be overwritten!

## For Your Friend (New Developer)

### First Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone <repo-url>
cd swift-cam

# 2. Run setup script
./setup-developer.sh

# 3. Enter your info when prompted:
#    - Team ID: ABC123XYZ
#    - Bundle ID: com.yourname.swift-cam

# 4. Open in Xcode
open swift-cam.xcodeproj

# 5. Build and run! üéâ
```

### Daily Work

```bash
# Pull latest
git pull

# Work on code
# ...

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "My changes"
git push

# Your personal config is preserved! ‚úÖ
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Setup script not found"
```bash
# Make it executable
chmod +x setup-developer.sh
./setup-developer.sh
```

### "Build fails with signing error"
1. Check `swift-cam/DeveloperSettings.xcconfig` exists
2. Verify your Team ID is correct
3. Make sure you're logged into Xcode (Preferences ‚Üí Accounts)

### "Config file being tracked by git"
```bash
# It shouldn't be! Check:
git status

# If it shows up, it's already in .gitignore
# Run this to remove it from tracking:
git rm --cached swift-cam/DeveloperSettings.xcconfig
```

## Files You'll Commit

‚úÖ **DO Commit:**
- Source code (`.swift` files)
- Project structure (`project.pbxproj`)
- Example config (`.example.xcconfig`)
- Documentation (`.md` files)
- Setup script (`setup-developer.sh`)

‚ùå **DON'T Commit:**
- Personal config (`DeveloperSettings.xcconfig`)
- Xcode user data (`xcuserdata/`)
- Build artifacts

The `.gitignore` handles this automatically! üéâ
